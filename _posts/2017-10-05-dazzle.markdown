<em>Originally written as wall texts for Schneider’s exhibition at Slought (4017 Walnut St, Philadelphia)</em>

Made during Schneider’s residency in Finland, <em>Dazzle Camouflage</em> alludes to two forms of protective disguise.
The first concerns a widely used ship camouflage during WWI, which doesn’t conceal the look of the target, but rather<!--excerpt.end--> its speed and range.
The second is the tendency for animals, insects and plants to take on the appearance of their environment. While most believe the point of this
is to scare off or escape the gaze of their predators, that is, to preserve one self, Roger Caillois proposes a dramatically different reading:
one that is aesthetic in nature. He argues that when animals, insects and plants try to mimic their surroundings, it is not because they want
to survive; it is, rather, because they want to be part of the “picture” that these surroundings form. More than the urge to be safe, then,
is a desire to break out of one’s skin and to be in communion with others (rocks, leaves, patterns, colors...) even if it means sacrificing
the sense of "I."

Here, the canoe pops and flashes. Like a wrapped gift, its zebra stripes are a travesty rather than a protection.  In painterly terms, the boat
stands out as the “figure” against the “ground” of the lake. Clearly, it doesn't bother to hide itself. Yet, the body of the boat is
immaterialized by the stripes so much that its “figure” all but dissolves. Masked by the pattern, its edges, joints, and hollows bleed into
one another, erasing the entire anatomy. In the way it disappears unto itself, the canoe recalls the schizophrenic’s description of their
whereabouts, which Caillois quotes in his essay, “I know where I am, but I do not feel as though I’m at the spot where I find myself.” This
out-of-body feeling of not being able to see yourself where you are, even though others can see you fine, is very much present in <em>Dazzle</em>.
