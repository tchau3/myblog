In this video, Yvonne Rainer delivers a lecture she gave for the independent study program at the Whitney Museum, which grapples with the kind of
humor symptomatic of our time — morbid, peculiar, hysterical. From the outset, she sees<!--excerpt.end--> how easily laughter can give way to anger, and asks how
does one joke and laugh at all, given the gravely twisted deeds that pervade our headlines? Or is it that we must joke and laugh so that we don’t
scream from our windows “I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!’”? 

Though she mainly addresses these questions to herself, Rainer doesn’t seek answers on her own. Instead, she looks to her audience for a
redemptive politics of the joke. As the only one of Schneider’s “reading women” who reads aloud, Rainer reminds us that reading, like laughing and
joke-telling, can and often has to be loud, emotive and social. When we read out loud, it becomes clear that our words are communal. Similarly,
jokes only exist when they are shared. When we “get” a joke and burst into laughter with the others, we are forming a community; together we are
letting our idiosyncrasies, our laughing bones (which are many and varied), triumph over the “serious” political clamors of our time, which tends
more and more to yield nothing but anger, isolation and paralysis.
